# Module 1 Challenge - Horiseon SEO Services Home Page

## Description

This project was an exercise in using the `Scout Rule` to refactor an existing project, making the page meet accessibility standards and simplify the HTML and CSS code.  I wanted to update the underlying files to meet all the criteria without affecting the layout of the page on the web at all. The semantic updates make this page more accessible to users with disabilities and increases the page's SEO value, by making its content easier to find by users through search engines.

I had some difficulties in cloning the existing code to a local repository, then reassiginging it to my own repo.  Right now, my repo still has a master and a main branch.  I'd like to learn how to fix that on this repo and to avoid this confustion in the future.
