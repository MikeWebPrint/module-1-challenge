# Module 1 Challenge - Horiseon SEO Services Home Page

## Description

This project was an exercise in using the `Scout Rule` to refactor an existing project, making the page meet accessibility standards and simplify the HTML and CSS code.  I wanted to update the underlying files to meet all the criteria without affecting the layout of the page on the web at all. The semantic updates make this page more accessible to users with disabilities and increases the page's SEO value, by making its content easier to find by users through search engines.

I had some difficulties in cloning the existing code to a local repository, then reassiginging it to my own repo.  Right now, my repo still has a master and a main branch.  I deployed to GitHub Pages based on the main branch.  Before submitting, I redid the clone and init process on a test directory with success.  I'm not going to mess with the master branch on GitHub at this point, but I've learned how to avoid that problem in the future.
